# storagedaddy

**Yours free forever, including all future versions.** Everyone who downloads during early access gets all future versions free forever. No trial expiry.

A free, open-source Mac footprint manager for developers. Understand what
projects, applications and AI tools leave behind; find large, stale or
replaceable material; and review every cleanup before moving anything to Trash.

The screenshot shows the real app with generated demonstration files. Its
sizes and timing are not a whole-disk benchmark.

## What's included

- A native SwiftUI and AppKit explorer with live scan results, treemap and
  other visual views, folder drill-down, sorting and an inspector.
- Developer Insights for caches, builds, packages, node_modules, Git data and
  recognized AI storage. Scan time, entries per second and sampled memory
  make the cost of scanning visible.
- Reviewed cleanup: stage candidates, inspect warnings, then confirm a move
  to Trash. Scanning never deletes files, and the app never empties Trash.
- Installed applications with icons, sizes, last-used metadata, categories
  and reviewed removal of eligible apps.
- AI Sessions for standard Claude and Codex transcript locations, independent
  of a disk scan. Older conversations can be exported locally before cleanup.
- Saved snapshots in History and signed updates through Sparkle.

## Install

The public DMG is Developer ID signed, notarized and stapled. It supports
**Apple silicon Macs with macOS 14 or later**. Download it, drag storagedaddy
into Applications and open it. Choose a disk or a folder to scan. Full Disk
Access is optional and helps with protected locations.

Automatic update checks are enabled by default. Installing an update requires
confirmation. The app menu also provides **Check for Updates…**.

## Build from source

Requirements: macOS 14+, Xcode with Swift 6, Python 3, Git, and Rust 1.82+
with Cargo for the Memory Pack helper. Dependencies are pinned with
`Package.resolved` and `Vendor/MemoryPack/Cargo.lock`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sarthakagrawal927/storagedaddy.git
cd storagedaddy
swift build -c release

# Build the included, compatible archive helper.
python3 scripts/prepare-memory-pack.py --source Vendor/MemoryPack --build
python3 scripts/package-app.py
open artifacts/StorageDaddy.app
```

The package script creates an ad-hoc signed development app. It increments a
local build number; it does not reproduce the signing or build number of the
public DMG. Signing keys and notarization credentials are not included. The
checked-in Sparkle key is public and cannot sign updates. For a fork, configure
your own update feed and signing key before distribution.

```sh
swift test
(cd scripts && python3 -m unittest test_sparkle_support)
cargo test --locked --manifest-path Vendor/MemoryPack/Cargo.toml
```

## Landing page

The static landing and Cloudflare Worker are under `site/`.

```sh
cd site
npm ci
npm run check
```

To preview the static page without Cloudflare, run
`python3 -m http.server 8792 --directory site/public/storagedaddy` from the
repository root. Public DMGs are hosted on the website and excluded from Git.
The deployment script requires the exact qualified DMG from `site/release.json`
to be present locally. Publishing updates additionally requires the owner's
Developer ID, notarization profile and Sparkle signing key.

## Privacy and limits

File processing stays on your Mac. There are no file uploads or AI calls.
Sparkle uses HTTPS to check for and download updates. Website request counts
are separate from app activity.

Scans can be partial when macOS denies access. On-disk sizes reflect allocated
storage; shared APFS blocks, hard links and snapshots mean totals are not a
promise of space reclaimed. Trash continues to occupy storage until you empty
it. Application associations and developer classifications are best-effort.

AI session counts describe transcript files, including nested subagent files,
not necessarily distinct conversations. Custom agent home folders are not
covered by the standard-location inventory. Agent skills, instructions, and
context policy are inventoried in ContextDaddy, not StorageDaddy.

Conversation archives retain supported prompts, replies and metadata while
omitting bulky tool traffic, attachments and other records. They are lossy
reading exports, not resumable backups. Exporting alone frees no space.
Original removal is a separate verified and confirmed cleanup action. Review
exports before sharing: credential masking is best-effort.

## License and acknowledgments

### Excluded folders

Click **Settings** at the bottom of the sidebar, or open **storagedaddy → Settings…** (⌘,) and select **Excluded Folders**. Add folders to omit them and their contents from future disk scans. Preferences save on this Mac across launches. Remove a folder from this list to include it again, then rescan for updated totals.

Exclusions also block storage cleanup of those folders, their descendants, and any parent that would contain them. Changing exclusions clears the cleanup queue and marks existing results for a rescan. Settings cannot change during an active scan or cleanup check. Independent Applications and AI tools retain their own inventory scope.

Cleanup uses one review list with a regeneration label on each item. Recognized caches and dependencies are usually regenerable; ambiguous build folders and other data are marked “Regeneration unconfirmed.” These labels are recovery guidance, not proof that an item is unused or disposable.
